This repository demonstrates and fixes two common errors in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers:

1. **ZeroDivisionError:** Occurs when trying to divide by zero, which happens when the input list is empty.
2. **TypeError:** Occurs when performing mathematical operations on non-numeric elements within the list.

The `bug.py` file shows the code with these errors. The `bugSolution.py` file provides corrected versions of the `calculate_average` function.
